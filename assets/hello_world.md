Here's a `test.md` file that includes various code blocks in Markdown format to test the `run_md.py` script. This Markdown file will contain C++, C, and Python code blocks, as well as some placeholders for the expected output.

### `test.md`:

```markdown
# Test Markdown File

This is a test Markdown file to check the functionality of the script.
```

## C++ Code Example

<codeStart class="skip"/>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;   
    return 0;
}
```

<codeEnd/>

## C Code Example

<codeStart/>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

<codeEnd/>

## Python Code Example

<codeStart/>

```py
print("Hello, World!"
```

<codeEnd/>

## Additional Python Code

<codeStart class="timeit"/>

```py
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius * radius

radius = 5
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
print(f"Area of circle with radius {radius} is {area}")
```

<codeEnd/>

## Expected Output Sections
### Explanation:

- **C++ Code Block:** Contains a simple program to print "Hello, World!".
- **C Code Block:** Contains a simple program to print "Hello, World!".
- **Python Code Blocks:**

  - The first Python block prints "Hello, World!".
  - The second Python block calculates and prints the area of a circle.
- **Expected Output Sections:** Placeholder sections where the script will insert the actual outputs generated by running the code blocks.

### Testing the Script

1. **Save the Markdown File:**
   Save the above content to a file named `test.md`.
2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the `run_md.py` script with the `test.md` file:

   ```bash
   python run_md.py test.md
   ```
3. **Verify the Output:**
   Check the output file (e.g., `test_output.md`) to ensure that the script has correctly replaced the placeholders with the actual outputs of the code blocks.

This `test.md` file should provide a comprehensive test for your script, covering different languages and code blocks, ensuring that the script handles various scenarios correctly.
